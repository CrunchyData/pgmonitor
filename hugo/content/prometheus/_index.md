## Installation

### RHEL / CentOS 7

#### With RPM Packages

There are RPM packages available to [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com) customers through the [Crunchy Customer Portal](https://access.crunchydata.com/).

After installing via these RPMs, you can continue reading at the [Setup](#setup) section.

##### Available Packages

| Package Name                  | Description                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| alertmanager                  | Base package for the Alertmanager                 |
| prometheus2                   | Base package for Prometheus 2.x                   |
| pgmonitor-alertmanager-extras | Custom Crunchy configurations for Alertmanager    |
| pgmonitor-prometheus-extras   | Custom Crunchy configurations for Prometheus      |

#### Without Crunchy Data Packages

For installations without using packages provided by Crunchy Data, we recommend using the repository maintained at https://github.com/lest/prometheus-rpm. Instructions for setup and installation are contained there. Note this only sets up the base service. The additional files and steps for pgMonitor still need to be set up as instructed below.

Or you can also download [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) from the original site at [https://prometheus.io/download](https://prometheus.io/download). Note that no base service setup is provided here, just the binaries.

##### Minimum Versions

pgMonitor assumes to be using at least Prometheus 2.9.x. We recommend to always use the latest minor version of Prometheus.

##### User and Configuration Directory Installation

You will need to create a system user named `ccp_monitoring` which you can do with the following command:

```bash
sudo useradd -d /var/lib/ccp_monitoring ccp_monitoring
```

##### Configuration File Installation

The files contained in this repository are assumed to be installed in the following locations with the following names:

###### Prometheus

The Prometheus data directory should be `/var/lib/ccp_monitoring/prometheus` and owned by the `ccp_monitoring` user.  You can set it up with:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0700 -u ccp_monitoring -g ccp_monitoring /var/lib/ccp_monitoring/prometheus
```

The following pgmonitor configuration files should be placed according to the following mapping:

| pgMonitor Configuration File | System Location |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| crunchy-prometheus-service-el7.conf | `/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service.d/crunchy-prometheus-service-el7.conf`  |
| sysconfig.prometheus | `/etc/sysconfig/prometheus` |
| crunchy-prometheus.yml | `/etc/prometheus/crunchy-prometheus.yml` |
| auto.d/\*.yml.example | `/etc/prometheus/auto.d/*.yml.example` |
| crunchy-alertmanager.yml | `/etc/prometheus/crunchy-alertmanager.yml` |
| alert-rules.d/crunchy-alert-rules\*.yml.example | `/etc/prometheus/alert-rules.d/crunchy-alert-rules-\*.yml.example` |

###### Alertmanager

The Alertmanager data directory should be `/var/lib/ccp_monitoring/alertmanager` and owned by the `ccp_monitoring` user.  You can set it up with:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0700 -o ccp_monitoring -g ccp_monitoring /var/lib/ccp_monitoring/alertmanager
```

The following pgMonitor configuration files should be placed according to the following mapping:

| pgMonitor Configuration File | System Location |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| crunchy-alertmanager-service-el7.conf | `/etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service.d/crunchy-alertmanager-service-el7.conf`  |
| sysconfig.alertmanager | `/etc/sysconfig/alertmanager` |


#### Windows Server 2012R2

There are Windows Servfer 2012R2 packages available to [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com) customers who contact Crunchy Data directly.

If you install the below available packages, you can continue reading at the [Setup](#setup-windows-server-2012r2) section.

##### Available Packages

| Package Name                  | Description                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| pgMonitor_server_1.0_Crunchy.win.x86_64.exe | Installer package for the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana servers |

### Upgrading

When upgrading from pgmonitor 1.x to 2.x, note that the alerting rules for node_exporter metrics have had many of their names changed. If you've changed the provided alerting rules file, installing the new package should create a file called `/etc/prometheus/crunchy-alert-rules.yml.rpmnew` and not overwrite your current file. You should be able to copy the new rules as needed from there.

## Setup

### Setup on RHEL/CentOS 7

#### Service Configuration

The following files contain defaults that should enable Prometheus and Alertmanager to run effectively on your system for the purposes of using pgmonitor.  You should take some time to review them.

If you need to modify them, see the notes in the files for more details and recommendations:

- `/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service.d/crunchy-prometheus-service-el7.conf`
- `/etc/systemd/system/alertmanager.service.d/crunchy-alertmanager-service-el7.conf`

The below files contain startup properties for Prometheues and Alertmanager.  Please review and modify these files as you see fit:

- `/etc/sysconfig/prometheus`
- `/etc/sysconfig/alertmanager`

The below files dictate how Prometheus and Alertmanager will behave at runtime for the purposes of using pgmonitor.  Please review each file below and follow the instructions in order to set things up:

| File                                     | Instructions |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `/etc/prometheus/crunchy-prometheus.yml` | Modify to set scrape interval if different from the default of 30s. Activate alert rules and Alertmanager by uncommenting lines when set as needed. Service file provided by pgmonitor expects config file to be named `crunchy-prometheus.yml` |
| `/etc/prometheus/crunchy-alertmanager.yml` | Setup alert target (e.g., SMTP, SMS, etc.), receiver and route information. Service file provided by pgmonitor expects config file to be named `crunchy-alertmanager.yml` |
| `/etc/prometheus/alert-ruled.d/crunchy-alert-rules-\*.yml.example` | Update rules as needed and remove `.example` suffix. Prometheus config provided by pgmonitor expects `.yml` files to be located in `/etc/prometheus/alert-rules.d/` |
| `/etc/prometheus/auto.d/*.yml` | You will need at least one file with a final `.yml` extension. Copy the example files to create as many additional targets as needed.  Ensure the configuration files you want to use do not end in `.yml.example` but only with `.yml`. Note that in order to use the provided Grafana dashboards, the extra "exp_type" label must be applied to the target and be set appropriately (pg or node). See the example target files provided for how to set the labels for postgres or node exporter targets. |

#### Blackbox Exporter

By default, the Blackbox exporter probes are commented out in the {{ shell }}crunchy-prometheus.yml{{ /shell }} file; please see the notes in that commented out section. For the default IPv4 TCP port targets that pgMonitor configures the blackbox_exporter with, the desired monitoring targets can be configured under the {{ yaml }}static_configs: targets{{ /yaml }} section of the {{ yaml }}blackbox_tcp_services{{ /yaml }} job; some examples for Grafana & Patroni are given there. It is also possible to create another auto-scrape target directory similar to {{ shell }}auto.d{{ /shell }} and manage your blackbox targets more dynamically.

If you configure additional probes beyond the one that pgMonitor comes with, you will need to create a different Prometheus {{ yaml }}job_name{{ /yaml }} for them for the given {{ yaml }}params: module{{ /yaml }} name.

An example rules file for monitoring Blackbox probes, {{ shell }}crunchy-alert-rules-blackbox.yml.example{{ /shell }}, is available in the {{ shell }}alert-rules.d{{ /shell }} folder.

#### Enable Services

To enable and start Prometheus as a service, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable prometheus
sudo systemctl start prometheus
sudo systemctl status prometheus
```

To enable and start Alertmanager as a service, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable alertmanager
sudo systemctl start alertmanager
sudo systemctl status alertmanager
```

### Setup Windows Server 2012R2

Currently the Windows installers assume you are logged in as the local Administrator account, so please ensure to do so before attempting the following.

Install the Prometheus, AlertManager, and Grafana servers by:

1. Find and launch the `pgMonitor_server_1.0_Crunchy.win.x86_64.exe` file previously obtained from Crunchy Data. It will present you with the following screen. Choose your install path and click 'Install'.

    ![server_installer_1.png](/images/server_installer_1.png)

2. Once installation has finished, clicked 'Close':

    ![server_installer_2.png](/images/server_installer_2.png)

3. The installer will launch the Windows services that were just installed. Click 'OK' to proceed:

    ![server_installer_3.png](/images/server_installer_3.png)

4. You will now be prompted to launch the configuration tool. Select 'Yes' to continue:

    ![server_installer_4.png](/images/server_installer_4.png)

5. Select '1' to tell Prometheus about the exporters it should scrape metrics from:

    ![server_installer_5.png](/images/server_installer_5.png)

6. Enter the hostname (just the hostname, not the FQDN) of the PostgreSQL server that the exporters are running on. Next, enter the IP address of the PostgreSQL server, and the WMI port (default is 9182):

    ![server_installer_6.png](/images/server_installer_6.png)

7. Enter a cluster name. This should be something simple but meaningful to identify the PostgreSQL cluster in question, e.g. payroll. Then enter the port used for both the cluster/global `postgres_exporter` (9187 by default) and the per-db `postgres_exporter` (9188 in our directions):

    ![server_installer_7.png](/images/server_installer_7.png)

8. You can now choose '2' to exit the configuration tool:

    ![server_installer_8.png](/images/server_installer_8.png)

9. You can now verify that Prometheus is running by loading [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your browser:

    ![server_installer_9.png](/images/server_installer_9.png)

10. Finally, verify Prometheus can access the exporters by choosing 'Status' and then 'Targets':

    ![server_installer_10.png](/images/server_installer_10.png)

11. You should see all configured exporters (1 per PostgreWSQL server, and 2 more per PostgreSQL instance), all with a green 'Up' status:
