  ## Monitoring for tcp services that don't have an associated exporter can be accomplished using the tcp probe 
  ##   of the blackbox_exporter provided by the Prometheus developers.
  ## Note this only provides a simple up/down that the service is listening on the given IP/port.
  ## If an exporter is available, an Absence alert for each node is recommended over a blackbox probe.
  ## Below is an example to monitor the services indicated by the comment. 
  ## The "targets" list is all that should need to be edited to customize to your setup assuming blackbox_exporter runs
  ##   on same system as Prometheus.
