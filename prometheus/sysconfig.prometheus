# This file must be in a pathname that matches the EnvironmentFile entry in the service file (Default: /etc/sysconfig/prometheus)
#
# --config-file: the path to the prometheus server configuration file
# --storage.tsdb.path: location that prometheus will store its time series database files
# --storage.tsdb.retention: how long prometheus will keep data before expiring it. This is how much data will be available to trend in grafana.
# --log.level: how verbose to make system logging. Setting to "debug" can help with diagnosing issues, but should not be left that way.
# --web.enable-admin-api: set this to make the admin api available which allows database snaphot backups. Left off by default for security.
