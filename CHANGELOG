1.7
-- Fixed duplicate and incorrect replication byte lag queries. The one contained in queries_common.yml should not have been there. It should be in queries_pg92-96.yml, but there was also one already there. However, the one already in pg92-96 was incorrect since prior to PG10, it requires superuser/security definer to fully access replication statistics. Corrected the version specific file to have the correct query. Made the query in the pg10 file consistent. Ensure you update your generated queries.yml file with he new queries.
-- Fixed the PostgreSQLDetails.json dashboard to use the correct replication byte lag metric (referencing above fix). The easiest way to fix this is to delete this dashboard and re-import it. Otherwise, if you've made customizations you don't want to lose, you can grab the correct metric query from the updated dashboard gauge and edit your existing dashboard to use it.
-- The combination of the above two fixes corrects the pgmonitor setup being able to properly handle there being multiple replicas from a single primary. Previously this would cause postgres_exporter to throw duplicate metric errors.
-- Fixed the query in queries_bloat.yml to be able to properly handle if there was a bloat amount larger than max int4 bytes. Ensure you update your generated queries.yml file with the new query.

 
1.6
-- Fixed formatting bug in crunchy-prometheus.yml. Thanks to Doug Hunley for reporting the issue.


1.5
-- Add support for disabling built in queries in postgres_exporter 0.4.5. Also explicitly ignore these metrics via a prometheus filter so they're not ingested even if new option isn't used. This means that v1.5 of pgmonitor now requires 0.4.5 of postgres_exporter by default.
-- Improved exporter down alert to avoid unnecessary alerts for brief outages that resolve themselves quickly.
-- Added new FilesystemDetails dashboard for grafana that is linked to from the Filesystem graph on PostgreSQLDetails.
-- Top level PostgreSQL grafana dashboard now identifies whether a system is read/write or readonly to better distinguish primary/replica systems.
-- Added instructions for non-packaged installation using pgmonitor configuration files.
-- Revised and better formatted README documentation


1.4
-- Fixed filesystem graphs in PostgreSQLDetails dashboard
-- Cosmetic changes to PostgreSQLDetails dashboard
-- Added instructions for importing dashboards via Grafana API


1.3
-- Fixed error in PG10 queries file. 
-- Fixed disk usage alert for prometheus to work better when there are many jobs with similar mountpoints. Also fixed syntax error in warning alert.
-- Moved connection stats query from common to version specific queries due to PG10 differences. Clarified naming of files for which versions they work for.
-- Added dropdown for the Job to the lower level drill down dashboards in Grafana. Allows selecting of a specific system from the dashboard itself without having to click through on a higher level.
-- Removed pg_stat_statements graph from PostgreSQLDetails dashboard. Needs refinement to make it more useful.


1.2
-- Change service and sysconfig files to use single OPT environment variable instead of one variable per cmd option
-- Fix error in PG10 monitoring functions file
-- Initial version of Prometheus 2.0 job deletion script. Requires API call not available yet in 2.0.0 for full functionality


1.1
-- Implement rpmnew/rpmsave feature instead of using .example files to prevent package overwriting user changes to configs


1.0
-- Initial stable release
