1.5
-- Add support for disabling built in queries in postgres_exporter 0.4.5. Also explicitly ignore these metrics via a prometheus filter so they're not ingested even if new option isn't used. This means that v1.5 of pgmonitor now requires 0.4.5 of postgres_exporter by default.
-- Improved exporter down alert to avoid unnecessary alerts for brief outages that resolve themselves quickly.
-- Added new FilesystemDetails dashboard for grafana that is linked to from the Filesystem graph on PostgreSQLDetails.
-- Top level PostgreSQL grafana dashboard now identifies whether a system is read/write or readonly to better distinguish primary/replica systems.
-- Added instructions for non-packaged installation using pgmonitor configuration files.
-- Revised and better formatted README documentation


1.4
-- Fixed filesystem graphs in PostgreSQLDetails dashboard
-- Cosmetic changes to PostgreSQLDetails dashboard
-- Added instructions for importing dashboards via Grafana API


1.3
-- Fixed error in PG10 queries file. 
-- Fixed disk usage alert for prometheus to work better when there are many jobs with similar mountpoints. Also fixed syntax error in warning alert.
-- Moved connection stats query from common to version specific queries due to PG10 differences. Clarified naming of files for which versions they work for.
-- Added dropdown for the Job to the lower level drill down dashboards in Grafana. Allows selecting of a specific system from the dashboard itself without having to click through on a higher level.
-- Removed pg_stat_statements graph from PostgreSQLDetails dashboard. Needs refinement to make it more useful.


1.2
-- Change service and sysconfig files to use single OPT environment variable instead of one variable per cmd option
-- Fix error in PG10 monitoring functions file
-- Initial version of Prometheus 2.0 job deletion script. Requires API call not available yet in 2.0.0 for full functionality


1.1
-- Implement rpmnew/rpmsave feature instead of using .example files to prevent package overwriting user changes to configs


1.0
-- Initial stable release
