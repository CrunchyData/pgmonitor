# pgmonitor

### [pgmonitor](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor) is your all-in-one tool to easily create an environment to visualize the health and performance of your [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) cluster.

pgmonitor combines a suite of tools to facilitate the collection and visualization of important metrics that you need be aware of in your PostgreSQL database and your host environment, including:

- Connection counts: how busy is your system being accessed and if connections are hanging
- Database size: how much disk your cluster is using
- Replication lag: know if your replicas are falling behind in loading data from your primary
- Transaction wraparound: don't let your PostgreSQL database stop working
- Bloat: how much extra space are your tables and indexes using
- System metrics: CPU, Memory, I/O, uptime

pgmonitor is also highly configurable, and advanced users can design their own metrics, visualizations, and add in other features such as alerting.

Running pgmonitor will give you confidence in understanding how well your PostgreSQL cluster is performing, and will provide you the information to make calculated adjustments to your environment.

## Purpose

pgmonitor is an open-source monitoring solution for PostgreSQL and the systems that it runs on. pgmonitor came from the need to provide a way to easily create a visual environment to monitor all the metrics a database administrator needs to proactively ensure the health of the system.

pgmonitor combines multiple open-source software packages and necessary configuration to create a robust PostgreSQL monitoring environment.  These include:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - an open-source metrics collector that is highly customizable.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - an open-source data visualizer that allows you to generate many different kinds of charts and graphs.
- [PostgreSQL Exporter](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter) - an open-source data export to Prometheus that supports collecting metrics from any PostgreSQL server version 9.1 and above.

## Supported Platforms

### Operating Systems

- Prometheus/Alertmanager & Grafana: CentOS/RHEL 7 or greater
- Exporters (node & postgres): CentOS/RHEL 6 or greater

### PostgreSQL

- pgmonitor plans to support all PostgreSQL versions that are actively supported by the PostgreSQL community. Once a major version of PostgreSQL reaches its end-of-life (EOL), pgmonitor will cease supporting that major version.
- 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4

#### Known issues

- PostgreSQL 10+ SCRAM-SHA-256 encrypted password are not yet supported by underlying go library used by postgres_exporter.

## Installation
